# React-with-CPlusPlus

This project is a simple yet effective application that solves several mathematical 
problems using C++. React is utilized for crafting an intuitive user interface.

The project operates in the following manner:

The React Frontend comprises three pages corresponding to three distinct mathematical problems. 
Each page features a set of input fields and a 'Submit' button. Upon the user's submission of a form, 
the inputs are transmitted to a Node.js server. This server then processes the inputs and executes a 
command in the command line interface (CLI). The commands that are executed correspond to the compiled 
C++ files. The output is subsequently returned to the Node.js server, then relayed to the React application, 
and finally displayed to the user.

## Getting Started

These instructions will provide you with a copy of the project 
that you can run on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To get this project up and running, you'll need to have the following installed:

1. **Node.js and npm**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that we'll use to run our backend server, and npm is a package manager for JavaScript. You can download both from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. **React**: You can install React by following the instructions (https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

3. **C++ Compiler**: This will depend on your operating system. For Windows, you can use MinGW. For Mac, 
4. you can use Xcode Command Line Tools. For Linux, you can use g++. Instructions for installing these can be found online.

After installing the above, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone
